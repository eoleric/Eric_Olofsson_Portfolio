Garvity Adventuré is a platform game developed as a school project.

The repository contains the full build if you want to try it out and some of the source code.

I wrote the code for most parts of the game including the entire character, all AI opponents and objects including camera movement.

Legend of Zoldar is a remake of the first Zelda game that 10 people in the class was tasked with remaking in a week. I was responsible for making the AI of all the enemies.

I also included a copy of my résumé.
